Running instructions:  the second AMC file provided for us (02_01.amc) is about 6000 keyframes so it takes a little while to parse.  The program is working.  

Basic functionality:
I tried to place the camera in the best place to view the models, but it's possible to left click and drag to rotate it manually.

1) Subject 1 displays (statically) when 1 is pressed
2) Subject 1 animates when 2 is pressed
3) Subject 2 displays and animates when 3 is pressed
4) Subject 1 and 2 display and animate when 4 is pressed
5) Whatever is displayed on the screen (1, 2, 1&2) resets to its skeleton position, orientation when 0 is pressed (note that in the case that both skeleton ASFs are 
located at the origin they will both return to the origin, in roughly the same position)
